USU Senior Project: Self-calibrating Audio Equalizer

We are two ECE students who love listening to music and want to demonstrate our skills in engineering through signal processing. We see a need to increase the availability of high quality audio and believe we can contribute to this area with our engineering abilities. For this reason, we have chosen a senior project on audio equalization to correct problems with loudspeakers and room acoustics. This project has the potential to affect anyone who enjoys listening to music.
